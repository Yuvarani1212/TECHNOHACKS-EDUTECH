PROJECT DETAILS :

TASK 1 :

🏘️ House Price Prediction
 
📍Overview: This project involves predicting the price of a house based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant attributes. Using a dataset with historical housing prices and features, we train a machine learning model to estimate the price of a new house.

📍Key Features:

Data Collection: Gathering a dataset that includes information about house features and their corresponding prices.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as needed.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

Model Selection: Implementing various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict house prices.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model by adjusting hyperparameters to enhance prediction accuracy.

📍Technologies Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

📍Highlights:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and analyzing the dataset to understand the relationships between features and house prices.

Model Training: Training multiple machine learning models and selecting the best-performing one.

Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the price of new houses based on their features.

Visualization: Creating plots to visualize the distribution of house prices and the performance of the predictive model.

TASK 2 :

🌐 Social Media Sentiment Analysis

📍Overview: This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of social media posts, such as tweets or Facebook posts, to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in the content. 

By processing and analyzing a dataset of social media posts, we gain insights into public opinion and trends related to specific topics or brands.

📍Key Features:

Data Collection: Acquiring a dataset of social media posts (tweets, Facebook posts, etc.) related to the topic of interest.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data by removing noise such as URLs, special characters, and stopwords. Tokenizing and normalizing the text for further analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify the sentiment of each post. This can include using pre-trained sentiment analysis models or building custom models.

Sentiment Classification: Categorizing the sentiment into classes such as positive, negative, or neutral based on the analysis.

Visualization: Creating visualizations to show the distribution of sentiments across the dataset, such as pie charts, bar charts, or word clouds.

Trend Analysis: Identifying trends or changes in sentiment over time or in response to specific events or campaigns.

📍Technologies Used: Python, pandas, NLTK, TextBlob, VADER, transformers (BERT), matplotlib, seaborn

📍Highlights:

Text Preprocessing: Techniques used to clean and prepare the text data for sentiment analysis.

Sentiment Modeling: Implementing and evaluating sentiment analysis models, including traditional methods and advanced NLP models.

Visualization: Creating visual representations of sentiment data to identify patterns and trends.

Insight Extraction: Analyzing the results to understand public sentiment towards the topic or brand and deriving actionable insights.

TASK3: 

📉 Employee Turnover Prediction

📍Overview: This project aims to predict which employees are most likely to leave a company by analyzing a dataset containing employee information.

By building a predictive model, we can identify employees at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to improve retention.

📍Key Features:

Data Collection: Obtaining a dataset that includes information about employees such as tenure, job role, salary, performance metrics, and other relevant features.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's performance.

Model Building: Implementing various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) to predict employee turnover.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC to determine its effectiveness in predicting employee departures.

Visualization: Creating visualizations to represent the factors influencing employee turnover and the model's predictions, such as feature importance plots and confusion matrices.

📍Technologies Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

📍Highlights:

Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing employee data for predictive modeling.

Predictive Modeling: Development and evaluation of models to forecast employee turnover risk.

Feature Analysis: Identifying key factors that contribute to employee turnover and their impact on the prediction.

Visualization: Visual representations to illustrate model performance and insights into turnover factors.
